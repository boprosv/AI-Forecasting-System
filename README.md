How It Works:
Upload your data (CSV or Excel)

Chat with AI — ask for summaries, trends, or forecasts

AI decides:

Does this need SQL?

Should we forecast the future?

Is a chart required?

AI agents go to work:

SQL Agent → Executes query

Forecast Agent → Predicts values (XGBoost Regressor)

Chart Agent → Renders visuals (Plotly)

Results are returned as answers, tables, or charts inside the chat.
